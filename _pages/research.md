## Working papers

- "Revealed Preferences of One-Sided Matching" [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14388)]  
	**Abstract**: Consider the object allocation (one-sided matching) model of Shapley and Scarf (1974). When final allocations are observed but agents’ preferences are unknown, when might the allocation be in the core? This is a one-sided analogue of Echenique, Lee, Shum, and Yenmez (2013). I build a model in which the strict core is testable – I say an allocation is “rationalizable” if there is a preference profile putting it in the core. Leveraging simple graph theory and combinatorial optimization, I give if and only if conditions for an allocation to be rationalizable. The main theorem also partially identifies the set of preferences which rationalize an allocation.

- "House-Swapping with Objective Indifferences" (with Will Sandholtz) [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09529)]  
	**Abstract**: We study the classic house-swapping problem of Shapley and Scarf (1974) in a setting where agents may have "objective" indifferences, i.e., indifferences that are shared by all agents. In other words, if any one agent is indifferent between two houses, then all agents are indifferent between those two houses. The most direct interpretation is the presence of multiple copies of the same object. Our setting is a special case of the house-swapping problem with general indifferences. We derive a simple, easily interpretable algorithm that produces the unique strict core allocation of the house-swapping market, if it exists. Our algorithm runs in square-polynomial time, a substantial improvement over the cubed time methods for the more general problem.
