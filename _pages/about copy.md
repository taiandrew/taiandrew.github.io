I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the [Defense Resources Management Institute](https://nps.edu/web/drmi), located at the [Naval Postgraduate School](https://nps.edu/) (NPS). I also teach at the Dept. of Defense Management (NPS's business school). I received my PhD in Economics from UC Berkeley.

My interests are primarily in microeconomic theory. Please see my [CV](files/Tai_CV.pdf).
