I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the [Defense Resources Management Institute](https://nps.edu/web/drmi), located at the Naval Postgraduate School. My interests are primarily in microeconomic theory. Please see my [CV](files/Tai_CV.pdf).

I received my PhD in Economics from UC Berkeley. Prior, I was a research assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and for Stefano DellaVigna.
